# IBB-Parkour-Game-Demo
My first Unity project: a simple 2D platformer demo. The player respawns when falling and progresses to the next level upon touching IBB public transport-themed items. Minimal graphics, focused on gameplay mechanics and coding.


#Features
-Start and Exit menu
-Respawn system
-Level transition upon item collection

#How to Play
-Press Start to begin the game.
-A / Left Arrow → Move Left
-D / Right Arrow → Move Right
-Space → Jump
-Avoid falling off the platform – if you fall, you respawn at the start.
-Reach the designated IBB public transport-themed item and progress to the next level.

#Notes
-Graphics are minimal since this is a learning project.
-Focus is on gameplay mechanics and scripting.
