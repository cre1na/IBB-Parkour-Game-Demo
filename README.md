# 2D Platformer Demo (Unity)

This is my first Unity project: a simple 2D platformer learning project.  
The player respawns when falling and progresses to the next level upon touching IBB public transport–themed items.  
Graphics are minimal, with a primary focus on gameplay mechanics and coding.

## Features
- Start and Exit menu
- Respawn system
- Level transition upon item collection

## How to Play
- Press **Start** to begin the game
- **A / Left Arrow**: Move Left
- **D / Right Arrow**: Move Right
- **Space**: Jump
- Avoid falling off the platform; if you fall, you respawn at the start
- Reach the designated IBB public transport–themed item to progress to the next level

## Notes
- Graphics are intentionally minimal as this is a learning project
- The main focus is on gameplay mechanics and scripting
- This game was created solely for learning purposes. :)
